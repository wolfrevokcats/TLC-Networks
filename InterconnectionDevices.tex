\chapter{Interconnection Devices}
router connects the network to the rest of the world. Form the layer1 point of you the network is an entity, from the layer2 point of view the netwrok is made of devices like hubs(does not separate the collision demain so that the transmission between the device connected with that hub can collide). 
This network is a pure tree so that if the connection/link goes down that go from a hub to the router, all the devices connected to it go down and are isolated.

For robustness hat you wonna have is a spanning tree-based network.


\subsection{Spanning Tree Algorithm}
The disconnection between the port is just logical. Disconnected ports keep forwarding pck generated by other bridge in the STA and will not forward any other data. 

Root = bridge with the lowest ID
